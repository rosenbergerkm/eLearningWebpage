Hello! I'm Kevin Rosenberger.

I hold a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Physics from North Carolina State University and a Master's Degree in Education from New Mexico State University. I currently work remotely from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania for University of New Mexico - Los Alamos as an Instructional Designer. As an instructional designer, I am committed to providing instructors with high quality support to their online courses by assisting with building their courses in Canvas, a popular Learning Management System. I also assist students with navigating online courses at the UNM Los Alamos through the Academic Support Center.

My portfolio demonstrates some of my best work and projects that I have completed individually and on a team during my time with New Mexico State University. Popular topics include: Community aspects of education, emerging technology, culturally responsive teaching, instructional design, synchronous instruction and pedagogy, and teamwork elements demonstrated in my work. Please feel free to explore my portfolio and contact me with any questions you may have about my work or services!
